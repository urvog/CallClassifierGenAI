Agent 1: Thank you, Agent 2. It's important to empathize with customers and assure them that we're doing everything we can to resolve their issues.

Agent 3: Agent 1, I just wanted to mention that we had a similar case earlier today. It turned out to be a faulty transformer, so the technician had to replace it. Make sure to inform the technician about this possibility when they reach Mr. Smith's location.

Agent 1: Thank you for the heads up, Agent 3. I'll make a note of it and inform the technician. It's always helpful to have technical information to assist our customers better.

Also, keep your refrigerator and freezer closed to preserve perishable food items. If you have any emergency lights or flashlights, make sure they are easily accessible. And finally, please avoid using any candles for lighting, as they can pose a fire hazard.

Additionally, we encourage customer feedback to continuously improve our services.

Customer: Alright, that's good to know. But what if I have another electrical problem in the future? Will I have to go through the same technician again?
