Agent 2: Of course, Sarah. I'll do my best to assist you. Could you please describe the issue you're experiencing?

Agent 2: I understand how frustrating that can be, Sarah. We'll definitely get this sorted out for you. Based on your description, it seems like there might be an issue with the wiring or the outlets themselves. To better assist you, I'll need to gather some additional information.
